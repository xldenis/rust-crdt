### `crdts`: family of thoroughly tested hybrid crdt's.

A family of CRDT's supporting both State and Op based replication. 

#### what the heck is a crdt?
CRDT's are the solution to highly available mutable state. Even if you don't explicitly use a CRDT when building a multi-device application that needs to be useable without an internet connection, you'll end up writing an adhoc, ugly, and buggy implementation of a CRDT.

CRDT expands to **C**onflict Free **R**eplicated **D**ata **T**ype, it referes to a family of structures that know how to *merge* without conflicts. There are two sub-families of CRDT's: CvRDT and CmRDT. They differ in how they replicate. CvRDT's are state based, meaning you would ship the entire CRDT state across the network to your peers. CmRDT's instead replicate by distributing all edits (called Op's) to each node in your system.

In this quick look at CRDT's, we'll just be poking at the structure of the CvRDT (CmRDT's are a bit more complex, but the ideas here all still apply). CvRDT structures define a `merge(a, b)` operation which takes states `a` and `b` produces a merged state. A simple example is a GSet (grow-only set), it's `merge` is the union of the two sets.


#### turning your structure into a crdt

CRDT's are all about partial orders, to turn a structure into a CRDT, you must first define a partial order over the state space of your structure, *BUT* you must do this carefully as the partial order also defines how your merge behaves. For example lets take a look at the state space of this structure:

<p align="center"><img src="art/crdt_statespace.png" /></p>

Now we need a partial order, our partial order must satisfy this constraint:

```
∀ s ⊆ S where S is your state space
∃ lub s and lub s ∈ S
```
`lub` is the Least Upper Bound, it takes a subset of the state space and produces a **unique** least upper bound of all states in the subset. Here's a partial order that satisfies the constraints:

<p align="center"><img src="art/crdt_partial_order.png" /></p>

Now say we want to merge two instances of this structure, well turns out we've already done the hard part as the partial order tells us what the final merged state will be.

`merge(a, b) = lub { a, b }`

The `merge(a, b)` operation is exactly the same as computing the least-upper-bound of the set `{a, b}`.

<p align="center"><img src="art/crdt_merge.png" /></p>

Looking over this partial order, we can derive a few other properties of CRDT's.
1. `merge(a, b)` always causes us to go *up or stay the same*
2. By 1. merge's are idempotent, since a previous state will be below or equal to the current state, remerging stale states will have no effect.
3. `merge(a, b)` is reflexive, commutative and associative

### How to use this library
#### Interacting with the CRDT's
Working with a CRDT is a bit different from datastructures you may be used to. Since we may be acting on data that is concurrently being edited by others, we need to make sure that your local edits only effect the data that you've seen.

##### Bad way of interacting with CRDT's
For example, if you clear a `Map`, we want to be able to say that this clear operation will only effect entries in the map that you are aware of. If you are not tracking this causal history of your edits correctly, you could end up deleting data that you are not aware of. e.g. a good way to lose data would be to do something like this:
1. you receive a `Map` CRDT from across the network.
2. you read the `Map`'s key/value pairs and display them to the user.
3. you receive an update version of the `Map` CRDT but the user has not refreshed their view.
4. The user chooses to clear the values of the `Map`. So you call `Map::clear` on your CRDT.

At this point you've potentially cleared data that the user didn't want to clear. To fix this, we need to include a `causal` context with the clear operation. This causal context is a vector clock (VClock) that stores the version of the `Map` that was seen by this user when they decided to `Map::clear()`.

##### Good way to interact with CRDT's
Lets take a look at what interacting with CRDT's looks like in using `crdts`.

1. First create an instance of the CRDT, we'll use the MVReg (Multi-Value Register) CRDT for this example. It allows us to store a value and resolves conflicting values by keeping both.
``` rust
let mut reg = MVReg::new();
```
2. To set a value in your CRDT, you'll need to provide a context (even for the initial value), the only way to get a context is to first read from the CRDT.
``` rust
let read_ctx = reg.read();
assert_eq!(read_ctx.val, vec![]); // the registers is empty!
```
3. Reading any state from a CRDT will produces a `ReadCtx`.to access the value from the `ReadCtx`, use the `.val` field. From the example above we see the register is currently not storing any values (empty `Vec`).

Now to make your edit to the `reg`, you'll derive the appropriate context for the edit you want to make, for edits that remove data, you'll need to use `.derive_rm_ctx()`, for adding new data you'll need `.derive_add_ctx(<actor_id>)` where `<actor_id>` is a unique identifier of whatever is acting on the CRDT.

``` rust
let add_ctx = read_ctx.derive_add_ctx(123);
let rm_ctx = read_ctx.derive_rm_ctx();

reg.set("Value".to_string(), add_ctx);                // We set the value of the register using the Add context
reg.clear(rm_ctx);                                    // We remove using the (stale) Rm context
assert_eq!(reg.read().val, vec!["Value".to_string()]) // and we see that the MVReg::clear() did not remove the new value
```

Now you may be wondering why we have a `"Value"` after we've cleared the register. The `"Value"` string was added with an `AddContext` that included a marker showing that new information from actor `123` was present. The clear operation used an `RmCtx` that was derived from a read where we did not have this information from actor `123`, only data that was seen at the time of the `read` that the `RmCtx` was derived from is removed.

Another trap you may fall into is reusing a context derived from one part of the CRDT to edit another part of the CRDT.
Steps to lose data:
``` rust
let read_ctx = map.get(&"key 1".to_string());
map.rm(&"key 2".to_string(), read_ctx.derive_rm_ctx());
```
Now you're using an `RmCtx` derived from another key, this `RmCtx` should only be used to remove the same data that it read. Same goes for the `AddCtx`, it should only be used to overwrite data that it had been derived from.

If you keep these things in mind, you'll have a good time :)
