//! # LSEQ
//!
//! An LSEQ tree is a CRDT for storing sequences of data (Strings, ordered lists).
//! It provides an efficient view of the stored sequence, with fast index, insertion and deletion
//! operations.
//!
//! LSEQ [1] is a member of the LOGOOT [2] family of algorithms for CRDT sequences. The major difference
//! with LOGOOT is in the _allocation strategy_ that LSEQ employs to handle insertions.
//!
//! Internally, LSEQ views the sequence as the leaves of an ordered, exponential tree. An
//! exponential tree is a tree where the number of childen grows exponentially with the depth of a
//! node. For LSEQ, each layer of the tree doubles the available space. Each child is numbered from
//! 0..2^(3+depth). The first and last child of a node cannot be turned into leaves.
//!
//! The path from the root of a tree to a leaf is called the _identifier_ of an element.
//!
//! The major challenge for LSEQs is the question of generating new identifiers for insertions.
//!
//! If we have the sequence of ordered pairs of identifiers and values `[ ix1: a , ix2: b , ix3: c ]`,
//! and we want to insert `d` at the second position, we must find an identifer ix4 such that
//! ix1 < ix4 < ix2. This ensures that every site will insert d in the same relative position in
//! the sequence even if they dont have ix2 or ix1 yet. The [`IdentGen`] encapsulates this identifier
//! generation, and ensures that the result is always between the two provided bounds.
//!
//! LSEQ is a CmRDT, to guarantee convergence it must see every operation. It also requires that
//! they are delivered in a _causal_ order. Every deletion _must_ be applied _after_ it's
//! corresponding insertion. To guarantee this property, use a causality barrier.
