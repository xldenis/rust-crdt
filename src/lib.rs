//! A pure-Rust library of thoroughly-tested, serializable CRDT's.
//!
//! [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types][crdt] (CRDTs) are data structures
//! which can be replicated across multiple networked nodes, and whose
//! properties allow for deterministic, local resolution of
//! possible inconsistencies which might result from concurrent
//! operations.
